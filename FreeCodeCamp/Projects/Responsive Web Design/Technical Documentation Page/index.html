                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                    <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

                        <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript is <b>case-sensitive</b> and uses the <b>Unicode</b> character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
                        <code>var Früh = "foobar";</code>
                        <p>But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
                        <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
                        <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. (For more information, see the detailed reference about JavaScript's lexical grammar.) It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
                        <p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.</p>

                <article>
                        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                        <code>(function() {
        "use strict";
        /* Start of your code */
        function greetMe(yourName) {
                alert('Hello ' + yourName);
        }

        greetMe('World');
        /* End of your code */
})();</code>
                        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! In the following pages, this guide will introduce you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you will be able to write more complex applications. But, for the time being, remember to always include the <span style="background-color: #ddd"><b>(function(){"use strict";</b></span> before your code, and add <span style="background-color: #ddd"><b>})();</b></span> to the end of your code. You will learn what these mean, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following —</p>
                        <li>Massively improve performance</li>
                        <li>Prevent stupid semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners</li>
                        <li>Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g. having something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).</li>

                        <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword,  followed by:</p>
                        <li>The name of the function.</li>
                        <li>A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                        <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, <span style="background-color: #ddd"><b>{ }</b></span>.</li>
                        <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named <span style="background-color: #ddd"><b>square:</b></span></p>
                        <code>function square(number) {
        return number * number;
}</code>
                        <p>The function <span style="background-color: #ddd"><b>square</b></span> takes one parameter, called <span style="background-color: #ddd"><b>number</b></span>. The function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the function (that is, <span style="background-color: #ddd"><b>number</b></span>) multiplied by itself. The statement <span style="color: blue; background-color: #ddd"><b>return</b></span> specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
                        <code>return number * number;</code>
                        <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions <b>by value</b>; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, <b>this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function</b>.</p>
                        <p>If you pass an object (i.e. a non-primitive value, such as Array or a user-defined object) as a parameter and the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example:</p>
                        <code>function myFunc(theObject) {
        theObject.make = 'Toyota';
}

var mycar = {make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 1998};
var x, y;

x = mycar.make; // x gets the value "Honda"

myFunc(mycar);
y = mycar.make; // y gets the value "Toyota"
                // (the make property was changed by the function)</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Array_object">
                <header>Array object</header>
                <article>
                        <p>An array is an ordered set of values that you refer to with a name and an index. For example, you could have an array called emp that contains employees' names indexed by their numerical employee number. So emp[1] would be employee number one, emp[2] employee number two, and so on.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript does not have an explicit array data type. However, you can use the predefined Array object and its methods to work with arrays in your applications. The Array object has methods for manipulating arrays in various ways, such as joining, reversing, and sorting them. It has a property for determining the array length and other properties for use with regular expressions.</p>
                        <p>The following statements create equivalent arrays:</p>
                        <code>var arr = new Array(element0, element1, ..., elementN);
var arr = Array(element0, element1, ..., elementN);
var arr = [element0, element1, ..., elementN];</code>
                        <p>element0, element1, ..., elementN is a list of values for the array's elements. When these values are specified, the array is initialized with them as the array's elements. The array's length property is set to the number of arguments.</p>
                        <p>The bracket syntax is called an "array literal" or "array initializer." It's shorter than other forms of array creation, and so is generally preferred. See Array literals for details.</p>
                        <p>To create an array with non-zero length, but without any items, either of the following can be used:</p>
                        <code>var arr = new Array(arrayLength);
var arr = Array(arrayLength);

// This has exactly the same effect
var arr = [];
arr.length = arrayLength;</code>
                        <div><b>Note</b> : in the above code, arrayLength must be a Number. 
        Otherwise, an array with a single element (the provided value) will be created. 
        Calling arr.length will return arrayLength, but the array actually contains empty (undefined) elements. 
        Running a for...in loop on the array will return none of the array's elements.</div>
